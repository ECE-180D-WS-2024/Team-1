The Puzzles folder contains all of the game logic regarding the 4 puzzles that are played in the game.

Code source:
For the code in this section, we referenced the documentation for common Python libraries such as OpenCV, Numpy, and SpeechRecognition.
Additionally, we also referenced various forums such as StackOverflow.

Decisions:
One of the key decisions we had to make was figuring out the design of what games to actually include in our project.

Future improvements:
For future improvements, we can probably make certain games more difficult, such as the wires game, as that game had a near perfect success rate.
Additionally, we may potentially add more games as well.
