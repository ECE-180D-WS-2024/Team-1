Our game is a physical implementation of the popular game, Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes.

Although we don't have a physical version of the bomb or GUI at this time, our current repository contains a working CLI version of the game.

Instructions on playing the game:

1. Have the defusing player run the command:
$sh PlayGame.sh

2. Have the instructing player open the instruction manual PDF.

3. As the defusing player, switch the orientation of the Nano33IOT Arduino to select a puzzle.

4. Complete all the puzzles by communicating together (without looking at each other's screens), while making less than 3 mistakes to win the game!
