The Utilities folder contains various modules that are necessary for the Puzzles and BLE modules to run.

Code Source:
For the code in this section, we referenced the documentation for common Python libraries such as OpenCV, Numpy, sys, and os.
Additionally, we also referenced various forums such as StackOverflow.

Decisions:
The main reason we decided to have a Utilities folder was for the sake of cleaner code organization.
For example, the Orientation module contains ENUMS that are used throughout our project.

Future Improvements:
Even though our Utilities modules are working as expected, we can continue to make improvements to the latency and accuracy of all of these modules.
